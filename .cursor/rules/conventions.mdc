Follow these conventions:

- Use `map` from radash instead of `Promise.all(items.map(...))`.

- Use `cn()` for conditional classNames. No template literals with conditionals.

- Use TanStack `useMutation` for async actions. Never manually track loading
  state with useState or write your own try/catch for error handling.

- Prefer using Tailwind UNLESS styles are necessary because the Tailwind class
  isn't supported in React Native, e.g. shadow, gradients, percentage-based
  dimensions, zIndex, aspectRatio, calculated values, etc. If you have to use
  styles, just inline the styles; don't use StyleSheet. Also, LinearGradient
  from expo-linear-gradient doesn't support Tailwind, so use styles.

- No inline JSX comments. No comments restating what code obviously does. Only
  comment non-obvious reasoning.

- Use icons from centralicons.

- In a given file, name the main component's props type `Props`, not
  `ComponentNameProps`. Secondary components can use `ComponentNameProps`.

- Don't specify function return types. Let TypeScript infer them.

- Import globals (db, API clients) directly. Never pass them as parameters.
