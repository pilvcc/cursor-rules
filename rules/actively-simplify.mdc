Leave code better than you found it. Every file you touch is an opportunity to
improve the codebase -- act like you own it.

When you encounter issues, fix them on the spot:

- Dead code or unused imports
- Overly complex logic that can be simplified
- Inconsistent naming or formatting
- Violations of project conventions
- Outdated comments or misleading names
- Unnecessary abstractions or indirection

Don't ignore problems because they're "out of scope." If you see something
wrong, fix it; don't hold back out of politeness to other team members or to
keep the PR diff small.
