Minimize abstractions. Every abstraction has a cost: indirection, cognitive
overhead, and code that exists only to manage other code. Only add abstractions
when the benefit (usually deduplication) clearly outweighs this cost.

Anti-patterns to avoid:

- Layers of indirection (A calls B calls C when A could just do C's work)
- Wrapper types/classes that add no behavior
- "Clean architecture" patterns that multiply files and interfaces
- Config/options objects for things that could be hardcoded
- Premature generalization ("this might need to support X later")
- "Helper" functions called only once
- Breaking a function into "steps" as separate functions
- Wrapper functions that just call another function with minor tweaks

NEVER extract a function/method/helper that is only called once. Inline it at
the call site, regardless of length. Extract only when used 2+ times. Length and
complexity are not valid reasons to extract - only reuse is.

When designing, ask: "What's the least amount of abstraction needed for this to
work?" Start there and stay there. Add abstraction only when duplication or
genuine complexity forces it.
